# pelotonjs

##Overview
Peloton is an experiment in stream-based, FRP physics engines for Cycle.JS applications.  Peloton may be usable for other frameworks, but there are many solid physics engines out there so this will not be a driver in the development.  

##Use
This is very much a work in progress. I'm just learning Cycle.JS, so expect major breaking changes with every commit for a while.

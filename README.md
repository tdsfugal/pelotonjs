# pelotonjs

##Overview
Peloton is an experiment in stream-based, FRP physics engines for Cycle.JS applications.  Peloton may be usable for other frameworks, but there are many better choices out there.  

##Use
This is very much a work in progress. I'm just learning Cycle.JS, so expect major breaking changes with every commit for a while.

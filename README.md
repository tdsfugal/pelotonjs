# Peloton.js

##Overview
Peloton is an experiment in stream-based, FRP physics engines for Cycle.JS applications.  Peloton may be usable for other frameworks, but there are so many solid physics engines out there that is not a requirement.  Try PhysicsJS or one of the many other more mature solutions.   

##Use
Peloton is very much a work in progress. I'm just learning Cycle.JS.  Expect major breaking changes on every commit for a while.
